Description:
The ODSI-DB contains spectral images of human teeth captured using
hyperspectral imaging technology. The database includes:

- Spectral images in the visible and near-infrared range (380-780nm)
- Multiple subjects with various dental conditions
- Calibration data for spectral analysis

Usage for Dental AI:
1. Spectral band analysis for early caries detection
2. Enamel demineralization mapping
3. Subsurface decay identification
4. Periodontal tissue assessment

File Structure:
- raw/: Original downloaded files
- processed/: Preprocessed images ready for training
  - train/: Training set (70%)
  - val/: Validation set (15%)
  - test/: Test set (15%)
